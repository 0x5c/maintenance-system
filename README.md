# Maintenance System *for windows 10*

*For lack of a better term*

This is currently a work in progress, almost still at the conceptual stage. I have no idea if I'll ever finish this.

## wot?

Yup, a *maintenance system* for windows.

But I already hear you ask: *What is that? Why that?*. Well, my goal is to make a central and modular interface for calling administration/maintenance scripts, binaries, and commands. I want a modular admin-menu, but also one that can handle being called by a script to run a particular module, all while managing and centralizing things like logging.

## The plan

*Coding, I guess*

Some example modules will be included in this repo shortly.
